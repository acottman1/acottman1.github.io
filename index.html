<h1>First page ever for Aron Cottman</h1>
<p>Here is a link to my first R Shiny app.  It isn't too flashy ot anything, 
    but more content and an actual page layout is coming. 
     This is how I plan on making my Chicago redlight data 
     project come to life.
    Click <a href="https://acottman1.shinyapps.io/First_app/">here</a> to go to my first Shiny app.
